# Contributing

### What to contribute.
If you want to contribute to my project, first of all, thank you! Secondly, you need to know what to work on, that information can be found by looking at the project board. It is spilt into cogs and done, in-progres, and done.

### Style
Just don't make it look ugly and folow PEP8 to the best of your ability.

### Contact
You can contact me, ir-3, on discord with the username *ir3#3333* to get in contact.
