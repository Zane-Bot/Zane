If you want to use Zane, I kindly request that you invite him to your server using my link instead of hosting him yourself.

My longterm goal is to lean C# and recreate the image functions in that to allow for a lot more speed and a lot less ram usage. However, that is a *long* time away from now. Thank you for checking out my Discord bot's repo.
